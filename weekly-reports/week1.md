# Trying to set core in place

## Week 1 report
- Misunderstood some requirements of POC and explored how external CLI's with binary can be used as plugins [#37](https://github.com/aerogear/charmil/pull/37)
- Implemented the wrapper approach according to the correct requirements [#45](https://github.com/aerogear/charmil/pull/45)
- Compared how wrapper and 2nd(plugin's use cobra) approaches are different, what do we loose/gain in wrapper approach [link](https://github.com/aerogear/charmil/discussions/43#discussioncomment-851017)

## Next Week
- Get the architecture of the final approach ready and move to 2nd phase
- Decide specific initial features and start implementing and documenting

## Blockers
- What validation do we do when we implement other than wrapper approach?
- Once the POC is ready then it should be easy to move with features
