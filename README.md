## ‚ùî Project Abstract


[Charmil](https://github.com/aerogear/charmil/) is a framework for building command line plugins on top of Golang [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) Library.
Charmil will grant your cobra-based CLI superpowers that cobra does not support and that show to be crucial tools for efficiency and effectiveness. These CLI's can also be added to any Host CLI as plugins.

</p>

Cobra is standard and very famous in the CLI industry and is being used in many industry projects such as Kubernetes, rhoas, gh-cli, etc. To make the development process easier we introduced Charmil.

Charmil solves many problems/issues faced by developers during development of CLI‚Äôs. The major feature that Charmil brings on the table is the ability to develop multiple fragmented CLI‚Äôs, maintained/working in separate repositories, and later embed/combine them in a single Host CLI.



### Charmil Components in brief
- Charmil SDK - For building mutlirepo CLI‚Äôs
- Charmil Validator - Cobra Testing Library
- Charmil CLI - Creating starter and managing CLI project
- Charmil Command Registry - Install CLI plugins with binary from maintained registry

### Charmil Validator
This is the charmil library for testing and controlling many aspects of cobra commands. Like to test react components we have react-testing-library, similar to that to test cobra commands with some given set of customizable rules, we have charmil validator.

Validator provides a customizable set of config attributes, for example -

```go
ruleCfg := rules.ValidatorConfig{
	ValidatorRules: rules.ValidatorRules{
		Length: rules.Length{Limits: map[string]rules.Limit{"Use": {Min: 1}}},
		MustExist: rules.MustExist{Fields: map[string]bool{"Args": true}},
		UseMatches: rules.UseMatches{Regexp: `^[^-_+]+$`},
	},
}
```
Rules provided by validator -

LengthRule
MustExistRule
UseMatchesRule
ExampleMatchesRule
It is recommended to use Charmil Validator while writing unit tests for the cobra commands. Validator can check if the commands are providing proper and latest documentation, length and presence of attributes, regex matching for command names etc. It also provides the feature to skip some command or skip including children for validation.

```go
validationErr := rules.ExecuteRules(cmd, &ruleCfg)
if len(validationErr) != 0 {
	t.Errorf("validationErr was not empty, got length: %d; want %d", len(validationErr), 0)
}
for _, errs := range validationErr {
	if errs.Err != nil {
		t.Errorf("%s: cmd %s: %s", errs.Rule, errs.Cmd.CommandPath(), errs.Name)
	}
}
```

Skipping commands for validation is very easy. To skip a single command just provide the CommandPath and to skip the entire chain of commands(including subcommands/children) use a asterik sign immediately after CommandPath

```go
ValidatorOptions: rules.ValidatorOptions{
	SkipCommands: map[string]bool{"mycli actions*": true},
}
```

Hence validator is very customizable and easy to use for developer productivity! For detailed documentation of charmil validator, visit Charmil Validator Docs

Here is a small diagram to show how is validator working under the hood.
