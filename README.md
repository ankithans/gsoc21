## ‚ùî Project Abstract
> NOTE: The Project is under development

[Charmil](https://github.com/aerogear/charmil/) is a framework for building command line plugins on top of Golang [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) Library.
Charmil will grant your cobra-based CLI superpowers that cobra does not support and that show to be crucial tools for efficiency and effectiveness. These CLI's can also be added to any Host CLI as plugins.
